## About

<p align="justify">   CRAVENGERS is a gamified web-based food ordering application where cravings meet challenges, turning every meal into an adventure. Users can order their favorite dishes, earn streaks, collect rewards, and level up their foodie journey. Developed using Python (Flask), SQL, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, Cravengers features two main modules that enhance both user experience and administrative efficiency. The Customer Module allows users to browse menus, place orders, and track their progress through a series of interactive, gamified challenges. On the other hand, the Admin Module enables seamless management of menus, order handling, and real-time monitoring of user activity. Whether you're aiming to unlock your next food badge or simply searching for a tasty bite, Cravengers invites you to assemble your cravings and embark on the ultimate foodie quest. </p>

## Features
